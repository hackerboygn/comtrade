Install Python 2.7.x, if it is not already installed.

Put all config files in the config directory.
Put all data files in the data directory.
The program uses a relative path to get to these files.

Usage:
python comtrade_b2a.py filename_01.cfg filename_01.dat

The above will create an output file called filename_01.dat.ascii in the output directory.
